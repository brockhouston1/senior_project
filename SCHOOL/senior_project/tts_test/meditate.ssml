    Take a deep breath in… <break time="2s"/> and slowly exhale… <break time="3s"/>  

    Settle into a comfortable position… whether sitting or lying down… <break time="2s"/>  
    Gently close your eyes… and bring your awareness to your breath… <break time="3s"/>  

    Feel the cool air entering your nose… <break time="2s"/> filling your lungs… <break time="2s"/>  
    and then slowly releasing… <break time="3s"/>  
    Let each breath… bring you deeper… into stillness… <break time="4s"/>  

    Now… bring your attention to your body… <break time="3s"/>  
    Notice any areas of tension… <break time="2s"/>  
    and with each exhale… allow them to soften… and release… <break time="4s"/>  

    Relax your shoulders… <break time="2s"/>  
    Unclench your jaw… <break time="2s"/>  
    Soften your hands… <break time="3s"/>  
    Feel a wave of calm… flowing through you… <break time="4s"/>  

    Shift your focus to the present moment… <break time="3s"/>  
    Let go of thoughts of the past… or worries about the future… <break time="4s"/>  
    Right now… the only thing that matters… is this breath… <break time="3s"/>  
    this moment… <break time="3s"/>  
    this space of peace… within you… <break time="4s"/>  

    If thoughts arise… acknowledge them… <break time="2s"/>  
    and gently… let them drift away… like clouds passing in the sky… <break time="4s"/>  
    There is no need to hold on… <break time="3s"/>  
    Just return… to your breath… <break time="4s"/>  

    Now… visualize a warm… golden light… surrounding you… <break time="4s"/>  
    This light is gentle… comforting… filled with positive energy… <break time="4s"/>  
    With each breath… this light expands… filling you with clarity… balance… and deep… inner peace… <break time="5s"/>  

    Feel yourself becoming lighter… more open… more at ease… <break time="4s"/>  
    In this moment… you are safe… <break time="3s"/>  
    you are whole… <break time="3s"/>  
    you are enough… <break time="5s"/>  

    Take a few more deep breaths… soaking in this stillness… <break time="5s"/>  

    And when you are ready… gently bring your awareness… back to the room… <break time="4s"/>  
    Wiggle your fingers… and your toes… <break time="3s"/>  
    Take one last deep breath in… <break time="3s"/>  
    and slowly exhale… <break time="4s"/>  

    Now… gently open your eyes… and carry this sense of peace… with you… into your day… <break time="5s"/>
