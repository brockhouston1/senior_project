    Let's begin by taking three deep breaths together.
    <break time="1s"/>

    <prosody rate="slow">
        Breathe in deeply through your nose
        <break time="3s"/>
        And exhale slowly through your mouth
        <break time="3s"/>
        
        Once more, breathe in
        <break time="3s"/>
        And breathe out
        <break time="3s"/>
        
        Last time, inhale deeply
        <break time="3s"/>
        And exhale completely
        <break time="3s"/>
    </prosody>

    <break time="1s"/>
    Now, bring your attention to your body.
    <break time="1s"/>
    
    <prosody rate="medium">
        Notice how your body feels where it makes contact with the surface beneath you.
        <break time="2s"/>
        Feel the weight of your body gradually releasing any tension.

    </prosody>

    <prosody rate="slow">
        Starting from your toes
        <break time="1s"/>
        Moving to your feet and ankles
        <break time="1s"/>
        Up through your legs
        <break time="1s"/>
        To your hips and lower back
        <break time="1s"/>
        Through your spine and upper back
        <break time="1s"/>
        Into your shoulders and neck
        <break time="1s"/>
        Down your arms to your fingertips
        <break time="1s"/>
        And finally to your head and face
        <break time="2s"/>
        Let each area soften and relax
    </prosody>

    <break time="3s"/>
    
    <prosody rate="slow">
        Now, focus on your breath
        <break time="1s"/>
        Don't try to change it
        <break time="1s"/>
        Simply observe its natural rhythm
        <break time="3s"/>
        
        With each inhale, feel your breath bringing in fresh energy
        <break time="3s"/>
        With each exhale, feel yourself releasing any remaining tension
        <break time="3s"/>
    </prosody>

    <break time="2s"/>
    
    <prosody rate="medium">
        If your mind wanders, that's perfectly normal
        <break time="1s"/>
        Gently bring your attention back to your breath
        <break time="3s"/>
    </prosody>

    <prosody rate="slow">
        Continue breathing naturally
        <break time="3s"/>
        Staying present with each breath
        <break time="3s"/>
        Finding peace in this moment
        <break time="4s"/>
    </prosody>

    <prosody rate="medium">
        When you're ready to conclude this practice
        <break time="1s"/>
        Slowly begin to deepen your breath
        <break time="2s"/>
        Gently move your fingers and toes
        <break time="2s"/>
        And gradually open your eyes
        <break time="2s"/>
        
        Take a moment to notice how you feel
        <break time="2s"/>
        Carry this sense of calm with you as you continue your day
